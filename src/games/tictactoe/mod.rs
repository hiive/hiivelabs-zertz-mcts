//! # Tic-Tac-Toe Game Implementation
//!
//! A minimal example demonstrating the `MCTSGame` trait for the classic 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe game.
//!
//! ## State Representation
//! - **Spatial state**: (2, 3, 3) array
//!   - Layer 0: X positions (player 0)
//!   - Layer 1: O positions (player 1)
//! - **Global state**: (1,) array
//!   - Index 0: Current player (0 for X, 1 for O)
//!
//! ## Actions
//! - Simple (row, col) placement moves
//!
//! ## Rules
//! - Players alternate placing marks
//! - Win: Three in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal)
//! - Draw: Board full, with no winner
